/**
 * This resource can be used to manage Artifactory's LDAP Group settings for user authentication.
 *
 * LDAP Groups Add-on allows you to synchronize your LDAP groups with the system and leverage your existing organizational
 * structure for managing group-based permissions.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as artifactory from "@pulumi/artifactory";
 *
 * // Configure Artifactory LDAP setting
 * const ldapGroupName = new artifactory.LdapGroupSetting("ldap_group_name", {
 *     descriptionAttribute: "description",
 *     enabledLdap: "ldap_name",
 *     filter: "(objectClass=groupOfNames)",
 *     groupBaseDn: "",
 *     groupMemberAttribute: "uniqueMember",
 *     groupNameAttribute: "cn",
 *     strategy: "STATIC",
 *     subTree: true,
 * });
 * ```
 * Note: `Name` argument has to match to the resource name.\
 * Reference Link: [JFrog LDAP](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/LDAP)
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * LDAP Group setting can be imported using the key, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import artifactory:index/ldapGroupSetting:LdapGroupSetting ldap_group_name ldap_group_name
 * ```
