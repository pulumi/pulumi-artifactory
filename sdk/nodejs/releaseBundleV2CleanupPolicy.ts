/**
 * Provides an Artifactory Archive Policy resource. This resource enable system administrators to configure and maintain JFrog cleanup policies for Release Bundles V2. See [Cleanup Policies](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-rest-apis/cleanup-policies-release-bundles-v2-apis) for more details.
 *
 * ~>Release Bundles V2 Cleanup Policies APIs are supported on Artifactory version 7.104.2 and later.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as artifactory from "@pulumi/artifactory";
 *
 * const my_release_bundle_v2_rb = new artifactory.ReleaseBundleV2("my-release-bundle-v2-rb", {
 *     name: "my-release-bundle-v2-rb",
 *     version: "2.0.0",
 *     keypairName: "my-keypair-name",
 *     skipDockerManifestResolution: true,
 *     sourceType: "release_bundles",
 *     source: {
 *         releaseBundles: [{
 *             name: "my-rb-name",
 *             version: "1.0.0",
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * const my_resource_bundle_v2_cleanup_policy = new artifactory.ReleaseBundleV2CleanupPolicy("my-resource-bundle-v2-cleanup-policy", {
 *     key: "my-release-bundle-v2-policy-key",
 *     description: "Cleanup policy description",
 *     cronExpression: "0 0 2 * * ?",
 *     durationInMinutes: 60,
 *     enabled: true,
 *     searchCriteria: {
 *         includeAllProjects: true,
 *         includedProjects: [],
 *         releaseBundles: [{
 *             name: "my-release-bundle-v2-rb",
 *             projectKey: "",
 *         }],
 *         excludePromotedEnvironments: ["**"],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import artifactory:index/releaseBundleV2CleanupPolicy:ReleaseBundleV2CleanupPolicy my-cleanup-policy my-policy
 * ```
