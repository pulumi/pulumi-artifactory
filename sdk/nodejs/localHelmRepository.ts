/**
 * Creates a local Helm repository.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as artifactory from "@pulumi/artifactory";
 *
 * const terraform_local_test_helm_repo = new artifactory.LocalHelmRepository("terraform-local-test-helm-repo", {
 *     key: "terraform-local-test-helm-repo",
 *     forceNonDuplicateChart: true,
 *     forceMetadataNameVersion: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Local repositories can be imported using their name, e.g.
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import artifactory:index/localHelmRepository:LocalHelmRepository terraform-local-test-helm-repo terraform-local-test-helm-repo
 * ```
