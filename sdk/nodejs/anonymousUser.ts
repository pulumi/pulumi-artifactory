/**
 * Provides an Artifactory anonymous user resource. This can be used to import Artifactory 'anonymous' user for some use cases where this is useful.
 *
 * This resource is not intended for managing the 'anonymous' user in Artifactory. Use the `artifactory.User` resource instead.
 *
 * !> Anonymous user cannot be created from scratch, nor updated/deleted once imported into Terraform state.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as artifactory from "@pulumi/artifactory";
 *
 * // Define a new Artifactory 'anonymous' user for import
 * const anonymous = new artifactory.AnonymousUser("anonymous", {});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import artifactory:index/anonymousUser:AnonymousUser anonymous-user anonymous
 * ```
