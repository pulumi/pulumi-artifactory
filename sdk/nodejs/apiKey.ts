/**
 * Provides an Artifactory API key resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory API keys.
 *
 * > **Note:** API keys will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. Read more about sensitive data in state.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as artifactory from "@pulumi/artifactory";
 *
 * // Create a new Artifactory API key for the configured user
 * const ci = new artifactory.ApiKey("ci", {});
 * ```
 * <!--End PulumiCodeChooser -->
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * A user's API key can be imported using any identifier, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import artifactory:index/apiKey:ApiKey test import
 * ```
