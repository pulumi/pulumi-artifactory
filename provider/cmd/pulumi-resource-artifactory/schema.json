                        "description": "The JFrog Platform Deployment (JPD) supports three ways of mapping groups to LDAP schemas: Static: Group objects are\naware of their members, however, the users are not aware of the groups they belong to. Each group object such as\ngroupOfNames or groupOfUniqueNames holds its respective member attributes, typically member or uniqueMember, which is a\nuser DN. Dynamic: User objects are aware of what groups they belong to, but the group objects are not aware of their\nmembers. Each user object contains a custom attribute, such as group, that holds the group DNs or group names of which\nthe user is a member. Hierarchy: The user's DN is indicative of the groups the user belongs to by using group names as\npart of user DN hierarchy. Each user DN contains a list of ou's or custom attributes that make up the group association.\nFor example, uid=user1,ou=developers,ou=uk,dc=jfrog,dc=org indicates that user1 belongs to two groups: uk and\ndevelopers.\n"
